# NFL Advanced Statistics Project

This will hone my artificial intelligence and data engineering skills while exploring some of my greatest passions in life - the NFL, fantasy football, and advanced metrics.

More coming soon...

# Anticipated Requirements
* DBeaver or another database manager of your choice
* A local PostgreSQL installation
* Python
* Deepseek local install - more instructions regarding this coming as it is integrated
* SQLAlchemy Python package for SQL connection to PostgreSQL database, Pandas for data manipulation, PyTorch

# Run Instructions
* You will need to load the CSVs into SQL tables
* You will then need to establish a connection to your local PostgreSQL database, using a connection string. An example can be found at the top of the data_ingestion.py file
* Instructions on running local Deepseek LLM will be added... best approach seems to be via Ollama

# Citations
All data currently in the database contributed from the CSVs found from this GitHub profile: nflverse. This repository contains the source code responsible for scraping data from multiple sources
